# 3. Ruby2D Input

OK, let's look at some input from Ruby2D. Let's just close the window when we
hit `Esc`. We can do this without a game loop since event handling is separated
from the game loop.

## Running

Run the following from the `pixelometry` gem's root folder:

```sh
bundle exec ruby examples/003_input/game.rb
```
