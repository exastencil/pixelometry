## 1. Hello World

This is the absolute simplest example using the least amount of code. It
doesn't even `require` Pixelometry. You could perhaps consider it cheating
as it uses the `Window.title` to output "Hello World!" and does not even
define a game loop. But it's a good starting point to see that Ruby2D is
working before going further.

## Running

Run the following from the `pixelometry` gem's root folder:

```sh
bundle exec ruby examples/001_hello_world/game.rb
```
