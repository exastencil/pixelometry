# Example Applications

Each example is a working Ruby2D / Pixelometry game. You can run them by using
`bundle exec ruby <folder>/game.rb` from this folder or
`bundle exec ruby examples/<folder>/game.rb` from the gem folder.

The sequential examples start by using Ruby2D concepts and gradually switches
over to Pixelometry concepts. Then they will show how to achieve common results
using Pixelometry, like player-controlled characters, collisions and other
interactions.

The named folders are more fleshed out sample games to give a sense of how to
implement an actual game. For more detailed documentation of each feature refer
to the documentation for explanations and capabilities.
